1. Check out a specific commit or pull request, so the input is a Git specific hashtag. There could be many files with any type.

2. Then go through a parsing pipeline, could be Regex based, to detect file types. Mainly, the files are grouped into two types: configs and programming language files. At this moment, my primary interest is the config files, such as Docker file, Cloudformation files, Terraform files and others. Hopefully, this pipeline is easy to be extended to support any types.

3. In the end, convert all config files into JSON and return. Actually, they should be passed into another pipeline for processing. But not covered in this project scope, which would be done in the following project

* List of config files that have to be filtered: Dockerfile, .gradle, 

* Example of input: micronaut-projects/micronaut-examples/9669e10633ec7bf81488952d015bf36e900f8bca/hello-world-java

* I need to get JSON files of each repository.
